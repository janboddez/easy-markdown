# Easy Markdown
Markdown parser "shamelessly gutted from [Jetpack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/)," with all things Gutenberg removed.

Not _really_ a fork of "Easy Markdown," either. It's really just Jetpack's Markdown module sans Markdown block (or any reference to blocks, or to other Jetpack functions). Should probably rename.
