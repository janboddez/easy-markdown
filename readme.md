# Easy Markdown
Markdown parser "shamelessly gutted from [Jetpack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/)," with all things Gutenberg removed.

Not _really_ a fork of "Easy Markdown," either. There's no syntax highlighting or anything. It's really just Jetpack's Markdown module sans Markdown block (or any reference to blocks, or to other Jetpack functions). Should probably rename.
